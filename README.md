## Prerequisites

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gergo-tar/gergotar-blog.git
    cd gergotar-blog
    ```
2. **Install Composer dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3. **Copy the example environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
4. **Configure your app:**
   Edit the .env file. See the [configuration](#configuration) section for more details.

5. **Generate the application key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
    You can also use Sail for this command after starting your container in local environment:
    ```bash
    sail artisan key:generate
    ```
6. **Create a symbolic link of the storage folder:**
    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```
7. **Run the migration and seeders:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

8. **Install Node dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the application in a local development environment using Sail:

1. **Start Sail:**

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```

    This command will build the Docker containers and start the application.
    For easier execution of Sail commands, set up a shell alias:

    ```bash
    alias sail='sh $([ -f sail ] && echo sail || echo vendor/bin/sail)'
    ```

    After setting the alias, you can run:

    ```bash
    sail up -d
    ```

2. **Build your assets:**
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
3. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000.)

4. **Running Artisan commands with Sail:**
   You can run any Artisan command using Sail:
    ```bash
    sail artisan migrate
    ```

## Project Structure

The project follows a Domain-Driven Design approach:

-   `app/App`: Contains the application layer, including Livewire components, resources, and routes.
-   `app/Domain`: Contains the domain layer with actions, models, and query builders.
-   `app/Support`: Contains a helpers.php file for global functions.

## Configuration

The application is configured using the .env file. Key configurations include:

-   `FILAMENT_USER_MAIL_DOMAIN`: Domain for Filament admin user emails. A user with the given domain can access the Filament dashboard. More about Filament in their documentation: [Filament PHP](https://filamentphp.com/).

-   `IP2LOCATIONIO_TOKEN`: API token for IP2Location geolocation services. More info [here](https://www.ip2location.io/).

-   `LOCATION_TESTING`: Enables location testing in the app. During testing, the returned IP address is in the USA. Learn more [here](https://github.com/stevebauman/location?tab=readme-ov-file#retrieve-a-clients-location).
